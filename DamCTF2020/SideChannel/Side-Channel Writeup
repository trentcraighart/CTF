Upon looking at the side-channel python file, we can see that it generates a password consisting
of numbers 0-9 and chars a-f. The lines that first caught my attention was the following line


if user_guess != password[i]
	time.sleep(0.1 * character_position_in_hex(password[i])


With the previous line, on our first run of the program, we can check the times it takes to load
the next prompt and use those to figure out the password.

For example if the first letter in the prompt took 0.7 seconds, we can reference the string: "0123456789abcdef"
and now we know the first char was 6
