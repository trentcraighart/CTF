To find the flag in this scenario I first played around with the source of the website
(As is tradition with all web based ctf challenges)

After that I looked at the hint and saw rfc5785, this relates to the website
URL being appended with /.well-known or /.well-known/exampleservice
With this we can easily find the flag
